# Docker and Singularity Support

## Introduction

Using container systems such as Docker and Singularity is an increasingly common
way to encapsulate dependencies and improve portability of pipelines. While it is 
straightforward to simply alter you commands to run inside containers directly 
within your Bpipe scripts, this makes the pipeline specific to and dependent on using 
a specific container technology which actually makes it less portable. It can also
be awkward to have to repetitively supply all the necessary arguments to the container 
runtime to ensure required storage is made available to the container. Therefore
Bpipe provides support to specify the container runtime as part of command configuration,
allowing you to write your pipelines generically and have the user configure the container
setup.

## Enabling Container Use

To configure a command to run inside a container, add the `container` key to its 
configuration, with subkeys `type` and `image` specifying the container runtime to use (`singularity` or `docker`), 
and the name of the container image. It is expected that these are available within the execution environment.

**Example: Run Command in Ubuntu 14.04 Image**

```groovy
commands {
    my_command {
        container {
            type='docker'
            image='ubuntu:14.04'
        }
    }
}
```

Then in your Bpipe script:

```groovy
my_stage = {
    exec "echo 'hello world'","my_command"
}

run { my_stage }
```

Note that the command itself does not have any reference to container settings, which 
is what allows you to create portable pipeline scripts that can run inside or outside of
a container system.

You can cause all commands to run containerised by setting it as a root property:

```groovy
container {
    type='docker'
    image='ubuntu:14.04'
}
```

## Reusing Container Configurations

In some situations you may wish to use the same container settings across many commands.

To do this, create a `containers` section in your configuration. Inside, create subkeys that
name reusable container settings. You may then use these names as values for the `container`
key for your commands.

**Example: Use Ubuntu 14.04 for Two Different commands**

```groovy
commands {
    hello { container='ubuntu' }
    world { container='ubuntu' }
}

containers {
    ubuntu {
        type='singularity'
        image='ubuntu:14.04'
    }
}
```

## Binding Storage

Without any special configuration, the storage available to the container runtime will follow the 
defaults that apply to the container system. Additionally, Bpipe will bind the current working directory
into the container.

To bind other storage storage into your container, configure them first as file systems with the `bind` type:

```groovy
filesystems {
    reference_data {
        type='bind'
        base='/storage/reference_data'
    }
}
```

Then you may add these named file systems as storage for your containers:

```groovy
containers {
    ubuntu {
        type='singularity'
        image='ubuntu:14.04'
        storage='reference_data'
    }
}
```

When configured this way, Bpipe will add the required instructions to bind the paths into your
container.
